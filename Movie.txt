I am looking forward to pursuing a career in software development and machine learning. i am also particularly interested in the applications of biomedical signals and their processing. i am looking for a project that overlaps both and that will be  extremely helpful for my career. you are one of the few professors which offer project that requires intricacies of both. considering this to be of mutual intereest, i would like to apply for a formal project under you next semester.

I understand that for pursuing this project, I might have to upskill/pre-read on some material provided by you and I am willing for the same.

My current skill set includes proficiency in programming languages like C++, JavaScript, Python and MatLab. I also did a project under the guidance of Prof. Manish Gupta on the topic: Scaling of MOSFET. 

I also assure you that I am willing to devote time and effort to this project and work with full sincerity under your guidance.
